The purpose of this webApp is to allow me to improve my iom skills.

Tuning of detector with two sliders for level and peak level detection
Interface :

 Display of leg duration as bar plots (one for upwind, one for downwind)

Web audio :
  play of start sequence
  detection of tick using microphone to detect leg duration
  play of last and average leg duration (warning sound 3 bips of increasing amplitude, double beep at the end for average)

Procedure :
